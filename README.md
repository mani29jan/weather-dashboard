I love to travel so I need a application i can use to see the weather outlook for multiple cities.
Using this app i can search for a city and it presents me with current and future weather conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
When I view current weather conditions for that city, I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
When I view the UV index, I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
When I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
When I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
